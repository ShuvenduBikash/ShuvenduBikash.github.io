                <br>

                <h5>Summary</h5>
                This is a system that acts as an assistant for faster and efficient typing by showing context-aware suggestion using artificial intelligence. We used LSTM for sequence modeling to understand the language and we used Beam search technique for generating multiple suggestions. Apart from this, we used encoder-decoder architecture to generate a long sequence with multiple words to generate more than one-word suggestions. This is sometimes very useful and more than one word is often very relevant to use without typing anything which helps to type efficiently.

                <br>
                <br>

                <h5>Summary</h5>
                The sketch is normally drawn for missing people. It is better to have a real image than a sketch to recognize someone. In this work, we proposed a generative method to generate human face from the drawn sketch. It uses the generative adversarial network as the main building block. Rather than using a random variable to generate a new image, we used a sketch to condition on and did not add any random variable as suggested in the Image-to-Image translation framework as we only need the best possible generated image.

                <h5>Summary</h5>
                Although RNNs are well known for sequence-related application, it has some drawback of vanishing gradient and comparatively slower nature. In this work, we have shown that CNNs can be very good and sometimes a better choice for voice classification task. We have experimented with different architecture and hyperparameters to report the best option for using CNN in such application.

                <h5>Summary</h5>
                Traffic jam is a huge problem in densely populated countries. Frequently emergency cars got stuck in traffic causing death threat to lives. We can help these cars by giving priority. For that, we first need to detect these can which can not be done manually by a human for all roads. In this work, we have proposed an emergency car detection system from CCTV footage using the deep convolutional neural network.

                <h5>Summary</h5>
                Predicting human age from the facial image has some important applications. But it is difficult to predict the actual age from the facial image. Various work has improved the accuracy of age prediction over time. In this work, we have used transfer learning of deep CNN for both regression and classification to improve the accuracy and reduce the loss for this task and achieved an impressive result on few benchmark data over all previous work.

                <h5>Summary</h5>
                In this work, we tried to improve the accuracy of understanding human emotion from facial image. We used recently successful deep convolutional neural network model and transfer learning on the pre-trained model. We conducted the experiment on two different datasets (JAFFE and KDEF). We pushed the accuracy of JAFFE to maximum and KDEF to 98.8%

                <h5>Summary</h5>
                Facial attribute classification has some important applications, like emotion classification and age prediction. The facial attribute classification task is harder than regular classification as there is too much correlation between different classes. In this work, we used Island loss with transfer learning on the deep convolutional neural network to improve this classification accuracy. We experimented on age and emotion classification task. In both cases, we got better accuracy than the previous methods on benchmark datasets.
